# Animated News Tickers

![Close-up photo of a news ticker](https://github.com/Pixel2407/animated-news-tickers/blob/main/NewsTicker_Cover.png)

Today, I wanna share to you a news ticker animation. News tickers (or crawler) are long strip of text that are found in lower-thirds of the screen. Commonly seen in TV news and some facades of buildings.

This project is all done using CSS Animations (although, I use SCSS). Since it uses lots of animation, it may cause some performance issues.
