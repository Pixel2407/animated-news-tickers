# Animated News Tickers

Today, I wanna share to you a news ticker animation. News tickers (or crawler) are long strip of text that are found in lower-thirds of the screen. Commonly seen in TV news and some facades of buildings.

Thanks to [Online Tutorial's video](https://youtu.be/3T4rD_P2nc8), I was able to recreate it from scratch. 
Here's the [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/Scept3r-ethan/full/yLbVNXR) of the project.

The project is all done using CSS Animations (although, I use SCSS). Since it uses lots of animation, it may cause some performance issues. Also, it works best on fullscreen mode.
